    <h3> Rules </h3>
    <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game for two players typically
    played using the players' hands. The two players each make a
    fist with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward.
    Together, they tap their fists in their open palms once, twice,
     and on the third time form one of three items: a rock
     (by keeping the hand in a fist), a sheet of paper (by holding
     the hand flat, palm down), or a pair of scissors (by extending
      the first two fingers and holding them apart).
    The winner of that round depends on the items formed. If the same
    item is formed, it's a tie. If a rock and scissors are formed, the rock
    wins, because a rock can smash scissors. If scissors and paper are formed,
    the scissors win, because scissors can cut paper. If paper and a rock are
    formed, the paper wins, because a sheet of paper can cover a rock. After
    one round is completed, another is begun. Play continues until one player
    reaches a predetermined score, or whenever the players' boredom is alleviated.
